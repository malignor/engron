      "value": "<p>As symbolized by the three daggers of her religious symbol, Calistria has three aspects: lust, revenge, and trickery. Silver-tongued and charming, she is a master of weaving insults into compliments and laying intricate groundwork for retribution at its finest. She is a goddess of vengeance, but it would be a mistake to assume that means she pursues justice. Calistria is fickle, shifting her loyalties and interests as her whims take her-though she never forgets a slight, and any who think she has forgiven will surely find it is only a matter of time before they are targeted by a long-term plot of revenge to lay them thoroughly low.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> pursue your personal freedom, seek hedonistic thrills, take revenge</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> become too consumed by love or a need for revenge, let a slight go unanswered</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> lust, revenge, and trickery</p>"
